## Introduction
[[toc]]

I now have a new blog within my personal website.

It is built using markdown (rendered by [`markdown-it`](https://npmjs.com/package/markdown-it)) and integrated to my custom build flow.

I'll be posting stuff here whenever I feel like it. 

There is still alot to improve and as I learn I'll be making the blog more advanced.

I'll be updating this specific post whenever I add new features, this page is supposed to show all the powers of this blog.

## Code Highlighting
And we also get syntax highlighting ;)
```js
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

console.log(add(5, 2));
```
Here's more:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello, World!\n");
  return 0;
}
```
Some Java?
```java
package com.ravener.stuff;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
  }
}
```
