# My Personal Website

Personal website, about me and all that stuff.

## Usage
View the site at [ravener.now.sh](https://ravener.now.sh)

For development: (Node.js needs to be installed)
```sh
$ npm run build
```
I use plain HTML/CSS no frameworks at all. Just a manual templating to keep pages cleaner, the base template is at [src/template.html](src/template.html) and all pages are under [src/pages](src/pages) running the above command generates the static HTML under `public/` and can be hosted anywhere easily.
